# how-long-to-beat-the-backlog
Small tool that reads ab Backloggery library export CSV, looks up times on HowLongToBeat and writes the result to a new CSV. This is an MVP, so don't expect this to be too polished.

# How to use
1. Clone the repository
2. `npm install`
3. Place a Backloggery library export named `input.csv` into the folder `input`.
4. `npm run`

The results are written to `output.csv` in the folder `output`.
